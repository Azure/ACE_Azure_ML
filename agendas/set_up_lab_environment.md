## Install AML Python SDK with Automated ML SDK on your Azure Databricks cluster

Please follow these [instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/service/how-to-configure-environment#azure-databricks) to setup an Azure Databricks cluster with the Python AML SDK.

## Import course jupyter notebooks

You can import the jupyter notebooks one my one, either by cloning this repository and uploading notebooks from your computer, or by directly importing them using their URL on GitHub.

Make sure you pay attention to the folder structure of the notebooks (i.e. day_1, day_2, and includes folder)

## Create a Databricks archive

If you are planning to run a workshop with this material, we recommend that you make the life of attendees easier, by exporting the notebooks as a DBC archive, so the students can simply import that archive.
