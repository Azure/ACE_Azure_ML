# Alternative Agendas

Depending on how much time you have, you could follow the below proposed agendas. 

We also created material for a 3h [hackathon](../hackathon/train-a-better-PdM-model-for-multiclass-using-azure-databricks.ipynb), which could be done after concluding any of the below agendas.

## Creating a lab environment

Please go to [this page](set_up_lab_environment.md) for instructions on how to set up your lab environment. You must follow these instructions whether you are being provided with a lab account or intend to use your own.
